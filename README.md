Each XML file contains the text of one volume of the original book series. The metadata has been added with place and collector attributes, which may sometimes differ in form from the text form metadata in the original text. The place and collector attribute lists also include attributes used only in the JR corpus. JR digitized is a collection of unpublished poems created to supplement SKVR, but the data has not been opened yet. 

SKVR type index is, for some parts, a work in progress.
- tyyppiluettelo.xml contains the original IDs, names and descriptions of the type index, but the references to SKVR volumes are not updated.
- viitteet_180221 contains the connections of type IDs to the poem IDs. * means the connection of a poem to the type is minor or only potentia.
- themetree contains a hierarchical version of the type IDs and their descriptions.
